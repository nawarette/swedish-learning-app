## 🇸🇪 Project: Swedish Learning App (Agent-Augmented)

**Objective:** Build a functional language app, master GitHub version control, and integrate Gemini-powered agentic logic via Cursor.

### 📍 Phase 1: Infrastructure & The Cloud Handshake (Current)

* [x] **Install Homebrew** (The Package Manager)
* [x] **Install GitHub CLI (`gh`)** (The Bridge)
* [x] **Authenticate GitHub** (`gh auth login`)
* [ ] **Establish Local Repo** (`git init` inside your project folder)
* [ ] **First Push to Cloud** (Connecting local code to GitHub.com)

### 🏗️ Phase 2: Static Foundation (Path A)

* [ ] **Code Audit:** Review your existing HTML/CSS/JS files.
* [ ] **Data Refactoring:** Separate vocabulary into a `vocabulary.json` file (Logic Separation).
* [ ] **GitHub Pages Deployment:** Host the site live so you can access it on your phone.
* [ ] **README Documentation:** Write the "handshake" for future AI agents.

### 🤖 Phase 3: Agentic Integration (Path B)

* [ ] **Cursor + Gemini Setup:** Connect your Gemini 3 API key to the Cursor editor.
* [ ] **MCP Implementation:** Set up a Model Context Protocol to let Gemini "read" your local vocabulary files.
* [ ] **The "Quiz Agent":** Build a feature where Gemini generates *new* Swedish sentences based on your progress.
* [ ] **Token Optimization:** Implement a caching strategy to keep your API costs near zero.

### 🧪 Phase 4: Scaling & Polish

* [ ] **State Persistence:** Use LocalStorage to remember which words the user knows.
* [ ] **Final Security Check:** Ensure no API keys are accidentally public on GitHub.

### The Socratic Inquiry: Planning the Next Move

Before we check off that next box, let's look at **Phase 1: Authenticate GitHub**.

1. **Strategic Logic:** Now that `gh` is installed, we need to run `gh auth login`. Why do you think it is better to login via a **CLI Tool** (`gh`) rather than just typing your GitHub password into the terminal every time you want to save your work?
2. **Naming Convention:** We need a name for your GitHub repository. Convention suggests `swedish-learning-app` or `vocab-master-sweden`. Which name conveys the **Intent** of the project better to an AI agent scanning your profile?

### Next Step

Ready to finalize the handshake?

**Your Action:** Type `gh auth login` in your terminal.

* Choose **GitHub.com**
* Choose **HTTPS**
* Choose **Yes** to authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials.
* Choose **Login with a web browser** (it will give you a code to paste).

**Would you like me to explain what the "HTTPS vs SSH" choice means before you click, or are you ready to jump in?**
